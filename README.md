# üß† Brain Tumor Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI scans using traditional machine learning algorithms. It involves preprocessing medical images, extracting features, and training classifiers to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor cases.

## üìå Key Features

- Image-based binary classification (Tumor vs. No Tumor)
- Preprocessing of MRI scans (grayscale conversion, resizing, normalization)
- Feature extraction using image processing techniques
- Model training and evaluation using multiple ML algorithms

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## üß† Model Workflow

1. **Image Preprocessing**  
   - Grayscale conversion  
   - Resizing (standardizing input size)  
   - Image thresholding and noise reduction

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)  
   - Pixel intensity patterns  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Algorithms used: SVM, Random Forest, KNN  
   - Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

4. **Results Visualization**  
   - Confusion matrix  
   - Performance metrics plots
